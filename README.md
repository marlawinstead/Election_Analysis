Overview of Election Audit

In this project, we are tasked with performing an election audit for a Colorado Congressional Precinct. Tom, an employee for the Colorado Board of Elections needs our help to automate the process of obtaining a vote count report. The following deliverables are requested: total number of votes cast, total number of votes per candidate, percentage of votes per candidate, and the winner by popular vote. The process will be done utilizing Python and Visual Studio Code.
